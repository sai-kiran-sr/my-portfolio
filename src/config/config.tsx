    projectName: "Customer-Churn-Analysis",
    projectDescription: `This analysis examines factors influencing customer churn, focusing on 
        contract types and payment methods. Month-to-month contracts see higher churn rates than 
        long-term contracts, highlighting their role in retention. Customers using electronic 
        checks also churn more frequently, possibly due to trust or convenience issues. 
        Additionally, those with a tenure of less than a year are more likely to leave, stressing 
        the need for strong early engagement. Visualizations reveal churn trends by contract type, 
        payment method, and tenure, emphasizing the importance of tailored retention strategies to reduce churn.`,
